# Erik's Vim Configuration

This is my vim configuration, which I have slowly been building up over a year or so now.

## How to Use
Simply clone the repository into your home directory, or manually download the `.vimrc` file and `.vim` directory, and place them within your home directory. When cloning, use the `--recursive` option to clone all submodules as well:
`git clone --recursive https://github.com/ErikSwan/vim-config.git`

Or, if you have already cloned or are using an older version of Git, run `git submodule update --init --recursive` to pull in all of the files for the included plugins.

If you want YouCompleteMe (an autocompletion plugin) to work, you will also need to install it by following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#installation).
