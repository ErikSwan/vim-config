# Erik's Vim Configuration

This is my vim configuration, which I have slowly been building up over a year or so now.

## How to Use
Simply clone the repository into your home directory, or manually download the `.vimrc` file and `.vim` directory, and place them within your home directory. When cloning the repository, make sure you run `git submodule --init --recursive` to pull in all of the files for the included plugins.

If you want YouCompleteMe (an autocompletion plugin) to work, you will also need to install it by following the [installation instructions](https://github.com/Valloric/YouCompleteMe#installation).
